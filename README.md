# Tensorflow implementation of Neural Network for MNIST dataset

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

We have trained a neural network with two fully connected hidden layers (a.k.a multilayer perceptron) and achieved an accuracy of approximately 93% on test images.
Adam optimization model is used for optimization and relu activation function is used.
